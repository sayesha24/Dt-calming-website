       <center> <h4>EFFECTS OF NATURE SOUNDS</h4></center>
        <p> The effect of nature sounds on our brain is that it reduces our stress levels, 
            and helps our brain to relax. <br/> 
            This is because nature sounds have a very pleasant pitch. <br/>
            Therefore, they seem very safe to the brain and make our mind feel that we are sitting in a safe environment. <br/>
            Thus, it relaxes our brain. <br/> 
        </p>
        
        <p>
 An experiment was held on the same. 
 Many people heard the nature sounds for a while, <br/>
 and their brain activity was measured through MRI scanner. <br/>
 Scientists had seen that before listening to these nature sounds their stress level was a lot, <br/>
 but as they kept listening to it, their stress levels kept on declining. 
 Thus, this is the effect of nature sounds on our brain</p>

        <h4><center>EFFECTS OF BRAINWAVES SOUNDS</center></h4>

        <h5> ALPHA</h5>
        <p>These are sounds which stimulate the alpha brainwaves are known as the Alpha Waves Music. <br/>
            Alpha waves music helps in lowering stress, improve creativity and decrease depression.</p>
        

        <h5>BETA</h5>
        <p>Sounds which stimulate the beta brainwaves are known as the Beta Binaural Beats. <br/>
            The benefits of this sound is that it helps increase concentration, it boosts motivation, <br/>
            when its heard for a long period of time, then linguistic, mathematic and reading skills also improve.</p>

            <h5>GAMMA</h5>
            <p>Sounds which stimulate the gamma brainwaves are known as the Gamma Waves Music. <br/>
                Gamma music can help in accelerating learning and processing the things you are learning. </p>

            <p>Therefore, this is how alpha waves music, beta binaural beats and gamma waves music can increase productivity. </p>
